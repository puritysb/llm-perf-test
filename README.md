# LLM Performance Test

This project is designed to perform performance tests on Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Setup and Execution

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: This project may have some Node.js related files, but Node.js specific settings are not required for the core performance testing.)*

2.  **Run Performance Test:**
    Execute the main test script:
    ```bash
    python test_performance.py
    ```

## Performance Test Log

Performance test results are logged to `performance_test.log`. This file contains details about each test run, including response times and memory usage.

## Project Structure

*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore (e.g., log files, generated CSVs, `node_modules`).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.
*   `test_performance.py`: The main script for running performance tests.
*   `cline_docs/`: (If applicable) Additional documentation related to the project or Cline's interaction.
*   `logs/`: May contain performance test log files.
