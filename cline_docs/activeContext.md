# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Project cleanup, GitHub repository setup, and documentation (`README.md`, `memory-bank`).

**Recent Changes:** Deleted generated files and directories (`summarize_perf_log.py`, generated CSVs, `generated_code/`, `repopackpy-output.txt`, `test.py`, `performance_test.log`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`). Initialized Git repository in the correct directory, added `.gitignore` (excluding logs, CSVs, `generated_code/`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules/`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`), committed and pushed to GitHub, fixed repository structure with force push, created and added `README.md`.

**Next Steps:** Continue exploring project functionality if needed, or await further user instructions.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:** Confirmed exclusion of `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` from the repository based on user input.

**Learnings and Project Insights:** Successfully corrected GitHub repository structure by re-initializing Git in the correct directory and force pushing. Learned the importance of verifying the Git repository location early in the process.
