# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Initializing the project memory bank documentation.

**Recent Changes:** Created the `memory-bank` directory and the `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` files.

**Next Steps:** Continue creating the remaining core memory bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) and populate them with initial context.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- The memory bank will follow the standard structure outlined in the user's custom instructions.
- Initial content is based on the provided project brief and observed project files (`test_performance.py`, `output.csv`, `performance_test.log`).

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
- The project appears to be a Python-based performance testing tool, likely involving running tests and analyzing output in CSV and log files.
