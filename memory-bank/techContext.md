# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:**
- Python (indicated by `.python-version`, `requirements.txt`, `test_performance.py`).
- Pandas (inferred from previous interactions and file analysis).
- Node.js related files (`package.json`) are present but excluded from the Git repository, suggesting Node.js might be used for related tooling or parts of the broader project context, but not the core performance testing script itself.

**Development Setup:**
- Requires a Python environment with dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
- Node.js and pnpm are likely installed locally but are not required for someone cloning the repository due to `.gitignore` exclusions.

**Technical Constraints:** (To be determined as the project is explored further)

**Dependencies:**
- Python dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.
- Node.js dependencies are managed via `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` locally, but these are excluded from the repository.

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- Execution of Python scripts for performance testing.
- Analysis of output files (`.csv`, `.log`).
- Use of Git for version control and collaboration.
- Use of pnpm for Node.js package management (locally).
