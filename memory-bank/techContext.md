# Tech Context

**Technologies Used:**
- Python (indicated by `.python-version`, `test.py`, `test_performance.py`, `requirements.txt`)
- Likely uses libraries for interacting with LLMs and potentially data manipulation (based on `requirements.txt` and the project's purpose).

**Development Setup:**
- Requires a Python environment.
- Dependencies are managed via `requirements.txt`.

**Technical Constraints:** (To be determined as the project is explored further)

**Dependencies:**
- See `requirements.txt` for a list of project dependencies.

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- Execution of Python scripts for testing.
- Analysis of output files (`.csv`, `.log`).
