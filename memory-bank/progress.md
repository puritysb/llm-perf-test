# Progress

**What Works:**
- Project cleanup is complete.
- GitHub repository is set up with the correct structure and essential files (`.gitignore`, `README.md`, `.python-version`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `test_performance.py`, `cline_docs/`, `logs/`, `memory-bank/`).
- `README.md` file is added to the repository.
- `node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` are excluded from the repository.

**What's Left to Build:**
- A deeper understanding and potential enhancement of the core performance testing tool functionality (`test_performance.py`).
- Detailed documentation of the testing process, LLM interactions, and result analysis within the project files themselves (beyond the memory bank).

**Current Status:** Project infrastructure setup and basic documentation are complete. The project is ready for further development or execution of performance tests.

**Known Issues:** None identified at this stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:** Shifted focus from initial memory bank setup to project cleanup and GitHub integration based on user request. Decided to exclude Node.js related lock file and modules from the repository based on user input.
