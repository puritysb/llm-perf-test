# Progress

**What Works:**
- The project directory structure is in place.
- The memory bank directory and core files are being initialized.

**What's Left to Build:**
- The core functionality of the performance testing tool needs to be explored and understood.
- Detailed documentation of the testing process, LLM interactions, and result analysis is required.

**Current Status:** Initializing project documentation and establishing the memory bank.

**Known Issues:** None identified at this initial stage.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:** The initial focus is on setting up documentation. Future decisions will involve understanding and potentially enhancing the core performance testing logic.
