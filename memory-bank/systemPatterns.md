# System Patterns

**System Architecture:** The project appears to be a command-line tool or script-based system for running performance tests.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Likely uses Python for scripting (`test_performance.py`).
- Input/output seems to involve CSV and log files (`output.csv`, `performance_test.log`).

**Design Patterns in Use:** (To be determined as the project is explored further)

**Component Relationships:**
- `test_performance.py`: The main script for running tests.
- LLM Frameworks/Models: External components being tested.
- Input Data (e.g., `example.csv`, `sample.csv`): Data used for testing.
- Output Files (`output.csv`, `performance_test.log`): Results of the tests.

**Critical Implementation Paths:**
- Loading and processing input data.
- Interacting with different LLM frameworks and models.
- Running performance tests and collecting metrics.
- Generating output reports in specified formats.
